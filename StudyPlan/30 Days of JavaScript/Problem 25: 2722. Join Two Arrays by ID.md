# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
We need to merge two arrays based on their `id` field to form a new array. 

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. These are comment delimiters for a multi-line comment to help explain and document code while preventing ignored text from executing. These comments are commonly used in formal documentation for better code understanding.

    ```
    /**
    * Multi-line comment
    */
    ```

2. This is a special type of comment called a JSDoc comment that explains that the function should take parameters named `arr1` and `arr2`, which are expected to be an `Array`.

    ```
    @param {Array} arr1
    @param {Array} arr2
    ```

3. This is a special type of comment called a JSDoc comment that explains what the code should return, which, in this case, is an `Array`. It helps developers and tools like code editors and documentation generators know what the function is supposed to produce.

    ```
    @return {Array}
    ```

4. This is how we define a function named `join` that takes two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, as its arguments.

    ```
    var join = function(arr1, arr2) {
        // code to be executed
    };
    ```

5. This initializes an empty object to merge and store objects based on their `id` while concatenating two arrays and updating the `map` through iteration to ensure unique objects based on their `id`.

    ```
    let map={},arrs=[...arr1,...arr2].map((e)=> map[e.id]={...map[e.id],...e})
    ``` 

6. This creates and then returns the final array by collecting the merged objects from the `map`.

    ```
    return [...Object.values(map)]
    ```

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
`n` is the total number of elements in both arrays. This is because the code involves iterating through the concatenated array once to update the map.

- Space complexity: $O(n)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
`n` is the total number of elements in both arrays. This is because the function involves storing merged objects in a map.

# Code
```
/**
 * @param {Array} arr1
 * @param {Array} arr2
 * @return {Array}
 */
var join = function(arr1, arr2) {
    let map={},arrs=[...arr1,...arr2].map((e)=> map[e.id]={...map[e.id],...e})
    return [...Object.values(map)]
};
```
