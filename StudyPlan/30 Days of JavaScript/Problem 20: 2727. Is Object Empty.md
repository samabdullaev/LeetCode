# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
We need to determine if an object or array is empty by checking for the absence of key-value pairs in objects or elements in arrays.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. These are comment delimiters for a multi-line comment to help explain and document code while preventing ignored text from executing. These comments are commonly used in formal documentation for better code understanding.

    ```
    /**
    * Multi-line comment
    */
    ```

2. This is a special type of comment called a JSDoc comment that explains that the function should take a parameter named `obj`, which is expected to be either an `Object` or an `Array`.

    ```
    @param {Object|Array} obj
    ```

3. This is a special type of comment called a JSDoc comment that explains what the code should return, which, in this case, is a `boolean` value. It helps developers and tools like code editors and documentation generators know what the function is supposed to produce.

    ```
    @return {boolean}
    ```

4. This is how we define a function named `isEmpty` that takes an object or array as an argument.

    ```
    var isEmpty = function(obj) {
        // code to be executed
    };
    ```

5. This checks if the number of keys in the object or the length of the array is equal to 0. This function returns `true` if the object is empty; otherwise, it returns `false`.

    ```
    return Object.keys(obj).length === 0
    ```

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $O(1)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
This is because the code only performs a single operation, and the time it takes to perform this operation does not depend on the size of the object.

- Space complexity: $O(1)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
This is because the function does not use any additional space that grows with the size of the input.

# Code
```
/**
 * @param {Object|Array} obj
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isEmpty = function(obj) {
    return Object.keys(obj).length === 0
};
```
